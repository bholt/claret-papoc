Building database applications out of data structures rather than simple string values allows the flexibility and fine-grained control of typical key-value databases while providing better performance and scalability. Composing transactions out of linearizable data structure operations exposes concurrency in a safe way, making it simple to implement efficiently and easy to reason about.
